General Project Summary

This web application will allow users to chat real-time about YouTube videos currently being played in the application window. Chatters will be able to add videos into a queue, downvote videos to skip it, and search for YouTube videos directly from the application. It will also utilize the Giphy API to allow chatters to post GIF reactions to the videos being watched.
